# Yaktaneh
Yet Another Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes Helper - /_jæktɛniː_/ - _yah-k-ten-ee_

## What is it?
A small python program to help with the game [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](http://www.keeptalkinggame.com/). It guides the _expert_ by giving them questions to ask the defuser, and then outputting instructions to give.

## How do I run it?
1. Be in an environment where your python3 is >=3.4, ad all the packages in ```requirements.txt``` are available. This can be a virtualenv, your system's python, or anything else.
2. Run ```solver.py```
3. ???????
4. Profit

## Doesn't this count as cheating?
Oh definitely.
However, it also makes the game possible to play effectively with only one expert, and it doesn't make the job of the defuser any easier ;)

## Which modules can Yaktaneh help solve?
I'm glad you asked - not all of them (yet). Feel free to open a pull request which adds a missing module!
